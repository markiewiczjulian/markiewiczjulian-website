      <description>Hi, you have found my blog1 where I post all things that might help someone in their web development journey.
My name is Julian Markiewicz and I am Poland based web developer mainly writing code in javascript or javascript frameworks (like angular2 or vuejs). I also try to do some backend (node.js) stuff because I find building a whole website from A to Z interesting. I am a big fan of open source.</description>

      <description>What is AWS Amplify? &amp;ldquo;AWS Amplify is an end-to-end solution that enables mobile and front-end web developers to build and deploy secure, scalable full stack applications, powered by AWS. With Amplify, you can configure app backends in minutes, connect them to your app in just a few lines of code, and deploy static web apps in three steps. Get to market faster with AWS Amplify.&amp;rdquo; This is a quote from the official Amplify website and while it sounds promising (like all new solutions) I wasn&amp;rsquo;t expecting that I would &amp;ldquo;Get to market faster with AWS Amplify&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>This post was originally published on dev.to website.
So Hi! Kinda awkward to write a post on Dev.to. I use tricks, tips, reading articles from this website almost every day, but I have never written a post in here (so for me this is a bit of a big deal, but from now on I will try to muster my excitement).
Github actions are something I was hoping to try sooner but there had always been an excuse.</description>
