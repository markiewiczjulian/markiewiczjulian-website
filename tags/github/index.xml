      <description>This post was originally published on dev.to website.
So Hi! Kinda awkward to write a post on Dev.to. I use tricks, tips, reading articles from this website almost every day, but I have never written a post in here (so for me this is a bit of a big deal, but from now on I will try to muster my excitement).
Github actions are something I was hoping to try sooner but there had always been an excuse.</description>
